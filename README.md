# Arribada open CTD

Used code is developt by [Joshua Girgis](https://github.com/joshagirgis) and is available at this link: https://github.com/joshagirgis/CN0349-Arduino-Based-Library

## Setup

We used STM Nucleo-F446RE development board and Analog devices CN-0349 evaluation board. Boards are connected with power supply (3.3V) and I2C communication.

For electrodes we used 6B pencil graphite, diameter = 3.8 mm, length = 20 mm and spacing = 1.5 mm. Dimensions are visible at picture below.

For testing we prepared a solution based on the average salinity of oceans, which is 35 g of salt per liter of water. Average conductivity of sea water is around 30 mS/cm or 3 S/m.
